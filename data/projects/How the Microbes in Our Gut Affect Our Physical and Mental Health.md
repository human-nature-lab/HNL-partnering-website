title: How the Microbes in Our Gut Affect Our Physical and Mental Health
goals:
- id: A
  cost: "$320,000"
  description: This level of support would provide funding to conduct specialized DNA sequencing as well as saliva proteome and metabolome analysis for 2,000 microbiome study participants over a 1- year period. This would result in new findings on the routes by which the microbiome might affect human wellbeing.
- id: B
  cost: "$1.7 million"
  description: Funds for this 2-year project would cover costs to conduct a second wave of data and sample collection for the initial 2,000 participants in our ongoing microbiome study, as well as microbiome sequencing for these samples. In addition to enriching our data set, this second wave of collection would allow us to explore the stability of the human microbiome over time as well as key transmission mechanisms important to the distribution of illness and wellness in a population.

excerpt: Can we map networks of microbe species in our guts in order to identify a set of species 
  crucial to our physical and mental health? Our bodies form the environment in which large number 
  of microbes live, and those microbes often work together to affect us, for better or worse.

There are more microbial cells living in and on our bodies than there are human cells that make up our bodies in the first place. The number of genes that these microbes have exceeds the number of human genes by more than an order of magnitude. Work over the past ten years has increasingly documented the impact of these microbes, collectively known as ‘the microbiome,’ on our own physical and mental health. They affect our risk for obesity, malnutrition, diabetes, depression, dementia, and many other outcomes. To complicate matters, the microbes within us have their own complex inter-relationships, such that constellations of species may work together to affect our lives.

To understand this, we propose to map the networks of microbial species based on whether they co-occur within people (similar to mapping whether animal species are inter-related based on whether they co-occur in the same physical place). We will use data from our long-term field site in Honduras, were we have already collected stool and spit from 2,000 people so far. We will discern whether any two species (out of the over 500 microbial species typically found in our guts) have a relationship to one another based on how often they co-occur in the thousands of humans we will examine. Then, we can use mathematical tools to assess the importance not only of particular species, but also of the microbial networks. This will allow us to explore how diverse communities of microbes work together to affect our risk for problems ranging from malnutrition to depression.
