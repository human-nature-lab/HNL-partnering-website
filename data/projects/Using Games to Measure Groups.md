Managers struggle with getting people to work together, and the performance of teams may often have more to do with how people interact than with who they are as individuals. For instance, accident rates at factories staffed by similar assortments of people may vary greatly, or rates of corporate policy violations (e.g., with respect to password sharing) or malfeasance may vary across groups of employees.  This variation may relate to how people are connected to each other or how they interact together to create norms within their groups. In other words, variation in many team performance outcomes may be a network phenomenon. Groups can have properties not present within individuals themselves. We see examples of successful group ventures all around us, yet we know that many work settings also seem plagued by dysfunction arising out of a failure to successfully meet challenges to achieving common goals.  Just as connecting the same carbon atoms differently has drastically different results – creating graphite or diamond – so too can putting the same people together in different ways result in phenomenal productivity or in dysfunction and failure.

We believe that new properties – like innovativeness, safety, reliability, and so on – can emerge within groups at workplaces because of the ties between the workers more than because of the workers themselves. In this project, we will build on tools – specifically, online cooperation games – we have developed to do field tests of this claim and to elucidate how we can specifically identify features of groups that lead to different kinds of success and failure.
