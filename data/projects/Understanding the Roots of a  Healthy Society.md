title: Understanding the Roots of a Healthy Society
goals:
- id: A
  cost: "$250,000"
  description: This level of support would cover the costs of conducting pilot work
    in the lab setting and in the field. Funds directly support team member effort
    as well as operations for the pilot testing in Honduras over a 1-year period.
- id: B
  cost: "$1.9 million"
  description: This level of support would cover the full design and implementation
    of this innovative research protocol using experimental tools to measure cooperation
    in 176 villages in Copan, Honduras as well as analysis work by our research team
    over 2.5 years. Expected outcomes would include published findings from this novel
    research program examining how the actual structure of human interactions in rural
    villages affects the common good.

excerpt: Why do some communities thrive and others succumb to dysfunction? There are
  deep roots to a healthy society, and, by implementing novel experimental approaches,
  we are able to understand how social connections in groups affect the ability of
  individuals to work together.

Groups can have properties not present within individuals themselves. We see examples of healthy, vibrant communities all around us, yet we know that many communities also seem plagued by dysfunction arising out of a failure to successfully meet challenges to the common good.  An analogy can help explain this: Just as connecting the same carbon atoms differently has drastically different results – creating graphite or diamond – so too can putting the same people together in different ways result in a dystopia or a “city on a hill.” In a stream of papers involving online experiments (published in PNAS in [2011], [2014], and [2019]), we have shown this to be the case.

Now, we would like to assess, using a sample of 176 villages and 30,000 people in Honduras (where we have been working for four years), whether we can measure such properties in real-world settings and whether such measurements might account for the differential ability of some villages to enact change or take care of collective assets, like wells or forests.  We will set up ‘labs in the field’ in this isolated rural area and measure the cooperativity of whole villages, and then we will merge that data to existing data we have on the detailed network structure of these villages.  We expect to be able to show that particular forms of social interactions, in actual field settings, are associated with more cooperation at the collective level, leading to more functional communities with better outcomes for their inhabitants.
