Groups can have properties not present within individuals themselves. We see examples of healthy, vibrant communities all around us, yet we know that many communities also seem plagued by dysfunction arising out of a failure to successfully meet challenges to the common good.  Just as connecting the same carbon atoms differently has drastically different results – creating graphite or diamond – so too can putting the same people together in different ways result in a dystopia or the proverbial “city on a hill.” In a stream of papers involving online experiments (published in PNAS in [2011](http://humannaturelab.net/publications/dynamic-social-networks-promote-cooperation-in-experiments-with-humans), [2014](http://humannaturelab.net/publications/friendship-and-natural-selection), and [2019](http://humannaturelab.net/publications/assortative-mixing-and-resource-inequality-enhance-collective-welfare-in-sharing-networks)), we have shown this to be the case.

Now, we would like to assess, using a sample of 176 villages and 30,000 people in Honduras (where we have been working for four years), whether we can measure such properties in real-world settings and whether such measurements might account for the differential ability of some villages to enact change or take care of collective assets, like wells or forests.  We will set up ‘labs in the field’ in this isolated rural area and measure the cooperativity of whole villages, and then we will merge that data to existing data we have on the detailed network structure of these villages.  We expect to be able to show that particular forms of social interactions, in actual field settings, are associated with more cooperation at the collective level, leading to more functional communities with better outcomes for their inhabitants.
