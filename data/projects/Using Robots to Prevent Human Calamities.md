The introduction of machines into our midst is often seen as a potential harm our ability to work together or even a risk to our personal safety, as with the public’s fears about autonomous vehicles.  Our recent work has shown how robots that speak in ways that convey vulnerability affect the conversational dynamics of human groups and enhance their satisfaction with their joint problem-solving efforts.

In new work, we hope to go further to show how robots can help people better coordinate actions that we often coordinate poorly, leading to calamities like stampedes and highway crashes. We are building a model of a city and placing human-driven cars within it, miniature cars that are remotely controlled by human drivers. We will study how AI-equipped cars that can be added to the traffic might enhance the ability of groups to navigate.  Other problems our work might address include stampedes in sporting events and religious festivals; slow-moving lines at theme parks; the difficulty of evacuation from buildings during earthquakes and fires; and rush hour traffic jams. Machines in our midst can be programmed to help with all these problems.
