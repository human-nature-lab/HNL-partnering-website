excerpt: How can physical robots affect collective action? By programming humanoid
  robots to speak and act in particular ways, we can modify how the humans observing
  the robots treat other humans, enhancing our ability to address collective action
  problems.

The introduction of machines into our midst is often seen as a potential harm our ability to work together or even a risk to our personal safety, as with the public’s fears about autonomous vehicles.  Our recent work has shown how humanoid robots that speak in particular ways can affect the conversational dynamics of human groups and enhance their satisfaction with their joint problem-solving efforts. Our lab is studying what we call “hybrid systems” composed of humans and machines interacting on the same playing field.

In new work, we hope to go further to show how robots can help people better coordinate their actions that they often otherwise coordinate poorly, leading to calamities like stampedes and highway crashes. We are building a model of a city and placing human-driven cars within it, that is, miniature cars that are remotely controlled by human drivers. We will study how AI-equipped cars that can be added to the traffic might enhance the ability of the overall groups to navigate.

Other problems this work might address include stampedes in sporting events and religious festivals; slow-moving lines at theme parks; the difficulty of evacuation from buildings during earthquakes and fires; and rush hour traffic jams. Machines in our midst can be programmed to help with all these problems.
