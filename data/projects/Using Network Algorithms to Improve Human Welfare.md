title: Using Network Targeting Algorithms to Improve Human Welfare
goals:
- id: A
  cost: "$350,000"
  description: This level of support would cover the costs of adding two post-doctoral
    researchers to our research team to conduct focused analyses. It would also provide
    project support to enhance our current dissemination and outreach capacity over
    a 1-year period.
- id: B
  cost: "$2.2 million"
  description: This level of support would cover costs related to conducting a re-mapping
    of social networks in all 176 villages in Copan, Honduras as well as an additional
    wave of data collection of a health and behavior survey for our cohort of 30,000
    people. This includes support for our research team to design and implement the
    study protocol, as well as operational costs related to field data collection
    in Honduras over 2.5 years. Expected outcomes would include major new discoveries
    about how network science can have a positive impact on human societies, and specifically
    about how to exploit peer effects to lead to sustained social change.

excerpt: How can we create epidemics of positive cultural changes, such as the adoption
  of better health practices, from scratch? By using an understanding of the mathematics
  of social networks, we can identify a small subset of people, in any group, whose
  structural position within the network makes them very influential. We can tap into
  this hidden group of influencers to drive the group towards desirable outcomes and
  improve human welfare.

Groups of people – whether in developing world villages, in schools, or in workplaces – often have suboptimal norms, particularly in relation to health practices.  We have shown that it is possible to use network targeting algorithms to produce cascades of adoption of new health behaviors within rural villages in Honduras.  By targeting just 5% of the residents of each village, who are chosen based on their position in the networks of connections within these villages, we substantially enhanced adoption of a desirable practice (the use of vitamins). ([See our 2015 Lancet article.](http://humannaturelab.net/publications/social-network-targeting-to-maximise-population-behaviour-change-a-cluster-randomised-controlled-trial))

Since that pilot project, we have mounted an enormous trial of network targeting in 30,000 people in 176 villages in Honduras. We have also completed a randomized controlled trial involving 5,000 people in 60 buildings in Mumbai. In both cases, we have shown, using these randomized controlled trials, that we can accelerate cultural change – for instance reducing inappropriate post-natal care or enhancing adoption of iron-fortified salt to counteract anemia. We can change the behaviors of whole populations for the better.

We need support to expand this work and to explore the durability of such large-scale changes in behavior and also to explore other mathematical rules that might make the process of network targeting even more efficient. Our goal is to provide a toolbox to interventionists to help them get the most out of their limited resources for improving public health and wellbeing.
