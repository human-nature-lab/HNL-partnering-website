Groups of people – whether in developing world villages, in schools, or in workplaces – often have suboptimal norms, particularly in relation to health practices.  We have shown that it is possible to use network targeting algorithms to produce cascades of adoption of new, health behaviors within rural villages in Honduras.  By targeting just 5% of the residents of each village, who are chosen based on their position in the networks of connections within these villages, we substantially enhanced adoption of a desirable practice.  ([See our 2015 Lancet article.](http://humannaturelab.net/publications/social-network-targeting-to-maximise-population-behaviour-change-a-cluster-randomised-controlled-trial))

Since that pilot project, we have mounted an enormous trial of network targeting in 30,000 people in 176 villages in Honduras. We have also completed a randomized controlled trial involving 5,000 people in 60 buildings in Mumbai. In both cases, we have shown, using these randomized controlled trials, that we can accelerate cultural change – for instance reducing inappropriate post-natal care or enhancing adoption of iron-fortified salt to counteract anemia.

We need support to expand this work and to explore the durability of such large-scale changes in behavior and also to explore other mathematical rules that might make the process of network targeting even more efficient. Our goal is to provide a toolbox to interventionists to help them get the most out of their limited resources for improving public health and wellbeing.
