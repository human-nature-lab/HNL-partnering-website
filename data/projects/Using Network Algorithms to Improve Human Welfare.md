title: Using Network Targeting Algorithms to Improve Human Welfare
goals:
- id: A
  cost: "$350,000"
  description: This level of support would cover the costs of adding two post-doctoral
    researchers to our research team to conduct focused analyses. It would also provide
    project support to enhance our current dissemination and outreach capacity over
    a 1-year period.
- id: B
  cost: "$2.2 million"
  description: This level of support would cover costs related to conducting a re-mapping 
    of social networks in all 176 villages in Copan, Honduras as well as an additional wave 
    of data collection of a health and behavior survey for our cohort of 30,000 people. This 
    includes support for our research team to design and implement the study protocol as well 
    as operational costs related to field data collection in Honduras over 2.5 years. Expected 
    outcomes would include major new discoveries about how network science can have a positive 
    impact on human societies, and specifically about how to exploit peer effects to lead to 
    sustained social change.

excerpt: How can we propel epidemics of positive cultural changes, such as the adoption of better 
  health practices, from scratch? By using an understanding of the mathematics of social networks, 
  it is possible to identify a small subset of people, in any population, whose structural position 
  within the network makes them very influential. We can tap into this hidden group of influencers 
  to drive the population towards desirable outcomes and improve human welfare.

Communities of people – whether in developing world villages, in schools, or in workplaces – often have suboptimal norms, particularly in relation to health practices. But, using large-scale experiments, we have shown that it is possible to use network targeting algorithms to produce cascades of adoption of new health behaviors within rural villages in Honduras. By targeting just 5% of the residents of each village, who are chosen based on their position in the networks of connections within these villages, we substantially enhanced adoption of a desirable practice (e.g., the use of vitamins). ([See our 2015 Lancet article.][lancet])

Since that first field trial, we have mounted an enormous randomized controlled trial of network targeting among 30,000 people in 176 villages in Copan, Honduras. We have also completed another randomized controlled trial involving 5,000 people in 60 buildings in Mumbai, India. In both cases, we have shown, using these experiments, that we can accelerate cultural change – for instance reducing inappropriate post-natal care or enhancing adoption of iron-fortified salt to counteract anemia. That is, we can change the behaviors of whole populations for the better.

We need support to expand this work and to explore the durability of such population-level changes in behavior and also to explore other mathematical rules that might make the process of network targeting even more efficient. Our goal is to provide a toolbox for interventionists to help them get the most out of their limited resources for improving public health and wellbeing in challenging settings.
